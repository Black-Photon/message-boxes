Bugs:
Please report bugs by adding to the 'Issues' section

New Features:
If you have an idea for a new feature, submit a pull request editing the IDEAS.txt file, explaining your idea
Also include code for the idea in the pull request if you have any

Manual Bug Fixing:

Developing:
I run using IntelliJ. Use testFiles.TestClass for testing

Formatting:
To keep consistency, please use the following format in files:
    
<!-- language: lang-java -->
    
    //VARIABLES --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    //Var Type 1
    private int randomVar;
    public String thisVar;
    
    //Var Type 2
    public int otherVar;
    
    
    
 	//METHODS ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 	
 	//Constuctor
 	thisClass(){}
 	
 	//Method Type 2
 	@Override protected void life(){}
 	/**
 	 * Documentation
 	 */
 	@FXML public String anotherMethod(){}
 	public void method();

Note the 3 lines above the METHODS line. You may exclude certain parts in files with small enough sections, or use differently if you feel it's necessary.
The point of this is to make things EASIER later on. If it becomes too difficult, you may use less, or make slight alterations

This project is intended to add different java message box types, so you can copy/paste the code and instantly use it.
All message boxes should be useful for the DEVELOPER, not the user. Feel free to suggest more box types using pull requests

This project has no current end date. It will be used in jOSeph and message-peoples projects and potentially more in the future
